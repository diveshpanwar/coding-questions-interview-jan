Problem Statement: Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to the method isSubstring. Return true or false as output.


Example 1
	s1: waterbottle
	s2: erbottlewat,
	o/p: true
	
Example 2
	s1: waterbottle
	S2: bottleerwat
	o/p: false
